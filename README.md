# Terminal

üêõ This is my own opinionated fork of the [original terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) for Hugo made by panr. Check that out for their repo for the main README file including features, configuration instructions, etc.

## Changes
- Removed `prism.js` in favour of the default [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)
- Removed elements for a more minimal look
- Framed content (like the Bearblog terminal theme) by default
- Emoji favicon support
- Post series (taxonomy) support
- Other minor misc visual changes
